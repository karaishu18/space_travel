    <p>Space exploration is the use of astronomy and space technology to explore outer space.
       While the exploration of space is carried out mainly by astronomers with telescopes,
       its physical exploration though is conducted both by unmanned robotic space probes and human spaceflight. Space exploration,
       like its classical form astronomy, is one of the main sources for space science.

While the observation of objects in space, known as astronomy, predates reliable recorded history,
it was the development of large and relatively efficient rockets during the mid-twentieth century that allowed physical space exploration to
 become a reality. Common rationales for exploring space include advancing scientific research, national prestige, uniting different nations,
  ensuring the future survival of humanity, and developing military and strategic advantages against other countries.
  The early era of space exploration was driven by a "Space Race" between the Soviet Union and the United States.
  The launch of the first human-made object to orbit Earth, the Soviet Union's Sputnik 1, on 4 October 1957, and the first Moon landing by the
  American Apollo 11 mission on 20 July 1969 are often taken as landmarks for this initial period. The Soviet space program achieved many of the
   first milestones, including the first living being in orbit in 1957, the first human spaceflight (Yuri Gagarin aboard Vostok 1) in 1961, the
   first spacewalk (by Alexei Leonov) on 18 March 1965, the first automatic landing on another celestial body in 1966, and the launch of the first
   space station (Salyut 1) in 1971. After the first 20 years of exploration, focus shifted from one-off flights to renewable hardware, such as the
    Space Shuttle program, and from competition to cooperation as with the International Space Station (ISS).</p>

  <div class="col-sm-6">
    <p>
      With the substantial completion of the ISS following STS-133 in March 2011, plans for space exploration by the U.S. remain in flux.
      Constellation, a Bush Administration program for a return to the Moon by 2020 was judged inadequately funded and unrealistic by an expert
       review panel reporting in 2009. The Obama Administration proposed a revision of Constellation in 2010 to focus on the development of the
       capability for crewed missions beyond low Earth orbit (LEO), envisioning extending the operation of the ISS beyond 2020, transferring the development
        of launch vehicles for human crews from NASA to the private sector, and developing technology to enable missions to beyond LEO, such as Earthâ€“Moon L1,
         the Moon, Earthâ€“Sun L2, near-Earth asteroids, and Phobos or Mars orbit.
         Starting in the mid-20th century probes and then human mission were sent into Earth orbit, a
         nd then on to the Moon. Also, probes were sent throughout the known Solar system, and into Solar orbit.
         Unmanned spacecraft have been sent into orbit around Saturn, Jupiter, Mars, Venus, and Mercury by the 21st century,
         and the most distance active spacecraft, Voyager 1 and 2 traveled beyond 100 times the Earth-Sun distance. The instruments were
          enough though that it is thought they have left the Sun's heliosphere, a sort of bubble of particles made in the Galaxy by the Sun's
          solar wind.
